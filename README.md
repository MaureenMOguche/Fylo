## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries


### What I learned

I learnt how to use CSS custom properties, how to declare them and use them throughout the workflow.

I also learnt about the Z-index and how it affects elements on the page.

Examples of what I learnt:

```html
<div class="float"><h1> Get early access</h1></div>

<img src="images/bg-quotes.png" class="quote">
```
```css
.float {
  position: absolute;
  top:450%;
}

.quote {
    position:absolute;
    z-index: -1;
    left: 6%;
    top:382%;
}
```
